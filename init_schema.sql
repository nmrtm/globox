-- 1. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis

-- 1.1 Can a user show up more than once in the activity table? - Yes
SELECT uid, COUNT(*) AS user_activity
FROM activity
GROUP BY uid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 1.2 Do we expect all users to make a purchase? - No
-- Do we want to include users regardless of whether they make a purchase? - Yes
SELECT *
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN activity a ON u.id = a.uid;

-- 1.3 What are the start and end dates of the experiment?
SELECT MIN(join_dt) AS start_date, MAX(join_dt) AS end_date
FROM groups;

-- 1.4 How many total users were in the experiment?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT uid) AS total_users
FROM groups;

-- 1.5 How many users were in the control and treatment groups?
SELECT "group", COUNT(uid) AS users_per_group
FROM groups
GROUP BY "group";

-- 1.6 What was the conversion rate of all users?
SELECT ROUND( (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT uid) FROM activity)::numeric / COUNT(uid) * 100, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM groups;

-- 1.7 What is the user conversion rate for the control and treatment groups?
SELECT "group", ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a.uid)::numeric / COUNT(g.uid)::numeric * 100, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM groups g
