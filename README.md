# GloBox  
### The Project  
#### My task was to analyze the results of the A/B test of a website banner for a fictional company GloBox, and provide a recommendation to stakeholders about whether they should launch the experience.  
  
### Context  
#### GloBox is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue. To this end, an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category as a banner was run at the top of the mobile website.  
  
### Objectives
#### • Boost the visibility of the Food & Drink section  
#### • Increase revenue  
  
### Key Metrics  
#### • Conversion Rate / Conversion Lift  
#### • Average Amount Spent  
  
### Process  
#### 1. The exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation were done in Beekeeper Studio using PostgreSQL.  
#### 2. After the data cleaning and transformation, a new dataset was created in Beekeeper Studio and exported to Tableau Desktop for exploratory data visualisation.  
#### 3. The same dataset was also analysed in Google Sheets for hypothesis testing, determining confidence intervals and power analysis.  
#### 4. Another dataset was also exported in the same way to Tableau Desktop later to check for novelty effects.  
#### 5. All the visualisations and insights were cohesively put together in the slide deck attached below.  
  
### Key Insights
#### 1. While there were no significant differences in the revenue, the conversion rate increased significantly in the treatment group.  
#### 2. Users from Mexico, men and Android users converted the most.  
#### 3. No novelty effects were detected.  
  
### Recommendation  
#### As only one of the objectives was met, I recommended to rerun the test with certain conditions. The details can be found in the slide deck and the technical report.
